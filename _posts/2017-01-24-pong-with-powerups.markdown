<h1>What is this?</h1>
A simple game of Pong made using Craftyjs and Javascript. The game as an AI and you, the player. When either one of you hit the ball there is a chance a power up will spawn for the enemy. If you get the power up you can use it by pressing SPACEBAR. The AI currently uses the power up instantly. Power Ups die out within 3 seconds of them spawning in if no one picks it up so you have to manage the time between hitting the ball or taking the power up.
