<h1>What is this?</h1>
An desktop "widget" that displays all your games on desktop so you can easily search and start the game. You can use the app to search, favourite, re-order favourites and sort the games alphabetically or according to most recently played games.

I made this application to learn TideSDK as it was interesting to me how you can make good looking GUI desktop applications just using HTML, Javascript and CSS. The reason I've stopped working on this before finishing it is finding good documentation to do some advanced low level WindowsAPI stuff was really hard. I also found Electron and was amazed by how much more advanced it seemed compared to TideSDK but it was still in beta back then so I didn't really bother porting it over to Electron.
